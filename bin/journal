# Add entries to a very simple journal markdown file

# (similar to how did.txt works)

journal_file="$HOME/Sync/notes/journal.md"

# timestamp format like "Wednesday, 2019-10-16 (11:58:20)"
timestamp="$(date +"%A, %Y-%m-%d (%H:%M:%S)")"

# do this in macvim - insert at top of file

# (from Vim FAQ: http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/vimfaq.html - insert a blank line with :put='')

# what is going on here?
# - adds the timestamp to the top of the file, with a '#' in front to be a header
# - then a blank line under that to space it out from the previous entry
# - then back to the top, and add two blank lines, so the result is that I start the entry with a blank line on either side
#
# like so:
#
# # Wednesday, 2019-10-16 (12:29:51)
#
# ‚ñè
#
# # Wednesday, 2019-10-16 (12:26:45)
