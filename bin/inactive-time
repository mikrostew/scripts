# > OS X has a timer that tracks the last time you moved the mouse, typed a key, or interacted with the computer.

# > In technical terms, the timer goes by the name HIDIdleTime and is part of IOKit's IOHIDSystem.

# get the line with this info
info_line="$(ioreg -c IOHIDSystem | grep HIDIdleTime)"
#echo "info_line: '$info_line'"

# pull out that inactivity value

  #echo "${#BASH_REMATCH[*]}"
